I work with computers, primarily focusing on cloud-native environments. 
My day-to-day involves building distributed systems, working with eBPF based systems, 
writing services in Go, and staring at monitor reading same logs again and again :) 
While Go is my main language, I enjoy exploring others - recently been tinkering 
with Zig and have professional experience with Python, TypeScript, and Rust.

What I enjoy most about technology is understanding how things work under the hood. 
This curiosity extends beyond computing - I spend a lot of time reading about various 
topics from philosophy to mathematics (specially discrete maths and theoreticalCS), watching football (keen eye on tactics), 
and diving into movies. There's always something interesting to learn, regardless of the domain.
