I primarily work with computers as a generalist, tackling any interesting challenge 
or necessary requirement. Beyond my day job, I enjoy reading books, playing and 
watching football, and nerding out over movies and mathematics.

Professionally, I'm currently involved in the security of cloud-native applications. 
This work encompasses gRPC and REST-based services, CLI applications, and kernel-level 
monitoring primitives such as eBPF. Most of my development is done using the Go programming language.
But just in terms of programming languages, I try to try most of them, currenly I am liking Zig a lot,
and I also have worked with Python, TypeScript, and Rust professionally.
