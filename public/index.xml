        <guid>http://localhost:1313/about/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I primarily work with computers as a generalist, tackling any interesting challenge
or necessary requirement. Beyond my day job, I enjoy reading books, playing and
watching football, and nerding out over movies and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, I&amp;rsquo;m currently involved in the security of cloud-native applications.
This work encompasses gRPC and REST-based services, CLI applications, and kernel-level
monitoring primitives such as eBPF. Most of my development is done using the Go programming language.
But just in terms of programming languages, I try to try most of them, currenly I am liking Zig a lot,
and I also have worked with Python, TypeScript, and Rust professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/p/hello-world/sunrise.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hello World!" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this-about&#34;&gt;What is this about?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this is just me writing about things that I find interesting, and that is a
lot of different things. From computers to philosophy, from books to movies, and
from napping to jogging. Although most of the time my thoughts are very jumbled,
writing about them actually helps in a lot of ways to organize things properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-even-write&#34;&gt;Why even write?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in general brings a lot of clarity, and IMO it should just be done for the sake of it.
There are a lot of events that take place in my day to day life, some are planned and some are
extraordinary, this is like logging them, mostly its &lt;code&gt;info logs&lt;/code&gt; but sometimes also &lt;code&gt;debug logs&lt;/code&gt;.
Also its fun sprinkling Haikus here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-often&#34;&gt;How often?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will try to write atleast once a month. But sometimes it simply depends on the &amp;ldquo;feels&amp;rdquo;. Afterall the
whole point of this is to have a random logging mechanism with no locks ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-and-writing&#34;&gt;Reading and writing.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually read a lot throughout the week, and this involves technical stuff, non-fiction, fiction, sci-fi,
and anything in the wild, I figured that writing and reflecting back has a nice processing feeback loop. This
specially has helped with understanding complex philosophical ideas, as I write I untangle.&lt;/p&gt;
